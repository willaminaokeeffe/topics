Well, today   sunny  beautiful    time,   worked   courage  asked  restaurant next door    ok   went  picked   trash.   said sure,  lot    lease,  'd  great!  Half hour later,  owner   restaurant came   introduced ,   thanked   cleaning  ,   talked     sad   one uses  lot,    thinking  put   patio   picnic tables  use   restaurant, etc.   walked around  lot   .     happy  meet  gardener   give advice   plants  work,   , etc.    left.

  later,  older lady (~50)   apartment overlooking  lot called  .   wanted  know   given  permission     lot.   explained  restaurant owner  given  permission,     picking   trash     sad  see  trash (  city lot alongside  sidewalk  road).   said ,   family  just bought  lot 3 weeks ago,   one  permission     lot.   said  restaurant   right   lot    bought     tired  restaurant trash   lot.  (Although  trash  old   never cleaned     years   .)   said       needed  leave.   said   put    Trespassing sign shortly.    clearly angry   .

Planted cabbage, kale  parsley. Two days later  went back   way  work  one last parsley plant.   five City landscapers revamping  whole place, using  lumber  improve  walkways.  thought   wasted  time  accidentally stolen supplies  City  use  improve  neighborhood.  felt pretty bad  like  wasted  ton  time  money. 

 went back  day later, landscapers    left  garden,  installed underground drip irrigation  added extra mulch compost.   awesome. Either  thought   City team  planted  food,    just finishing  job,   just thought   cool,  less work  get  reebar    ground (hammered  almost three feet deep),  just worked around .
